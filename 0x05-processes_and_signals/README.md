## Introduction

In software engineering, signals and processes are crucial concepts that allow applications to handle events, manage concurrency, and achieve efficient multitasking. This project provides insights into how software engineers can leverage signals and processes to build robust and responsive software systems.

## Signals

### What are Signals in Software Engineering?

Signals in software engineering are mechanisms used to notify processes or threads of specific events or conditions. This section explains how signals enable inter-process communication and facilitate event-driven architectures.

### Signaling Mechanisms

Various signaling mechanisms are available in software engineering. This section explores different approaches such as signals, callbacks, and observer patterns, along with their pros and cons.

### Signal Handling

Efficient signal handling is essential to prevent unexpected behavior in software systems. This section covers best practices for signal handling, including handling interruptions and managing signal conflicts.

## Processes

### Understanding Processes

Understanding the concept of processes is crucial for building scalable applications. This section delves into the fundamentals of processes, their lifecycle, and how they interact with the underlying operating system.

### Managing Processes

Proper process management is essential for resource utilization and system stability. This section discusses techniques for creating, terminating, and monitoring processes effectively.

### Concurrency and Parallelism

Concurrency and parallelism are key strategies to achieve efficient processing. This section explores the differences between concurrent and parallel execution and how to design applications that leverage these concepts.

## Examples

### Example 1: Asynchronous Event Handling

An example demonstrating how to implement asynchronous event handling using signals or other signaling mechanisms in a software application.

### Example 2: Multi-threaded Process Management

An example illustrating how to manage multiple processes or threads concurrently to improve performance in a software system.

## Best Practices

### Designing with Signals and Processes

Guidelines and best practices for designing software systems with signals and processes at their core. This section covers patterns and architectural considerations for robust and scalable applications.

### Error Handling and Graceful Shutdown

Ensuring proper error handling and graceful shutdown mechanisms when dealing with signals and processes. This section emphasizes the importance of clean application termination.
