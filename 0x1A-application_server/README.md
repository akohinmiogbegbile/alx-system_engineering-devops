## API Endpoints

The Application Server exposes the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/resource`: Retrieve a resource.
- `POST /api/resource`: Create a new resource.
- `PUT /api/resource/:id`: Update an existing resource.
- `DELETE /api/resource/:id`: Delete a resource.

For detailed information on each endpoint and the required parameters, refer to the API documentation.
